### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

1. What is PostgreSQL?
	- postgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system(RDBMS)
	- It is known for its robustness, extensibility, and compliance with SQL standards
	- Key features include: 
		- ACID Compliance
		- Extensibility
		- Concurency Control
		- Advanced Data Types
		- Full-Text Search
		- Replication and Clustering
		- Community and Support

2. What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
	- They both have distinct roles and functionalities
	- SQL is a standard language used to communicate with and manage databases 		while PostgreSQL is a specific type of relation database management 		system that uses SQL as its query language 

3. In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?
	- The basic syntax to connect to a database is:
	` psql -h hostname -p port -d dbname `
	- First you want to open the Terminal or Command Prompt
	- Second, Run the psql command
	- Third, Enter password if required
	
	

4. What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?
	- HAVING is used to filter groups after the GROUP BY clause has been applied
	- WHERE is used to filter rows before any groupings are made
	- WHERE is excuted before the GROUP BY clause
	- HAVING is executed after the GROUP BY clause

5. What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?
	- They both combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column 		between them but what makes them different is how they handle the 		unmatched rows
	- INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables
	- OUTER JOIN returns all rows from one table and the matched rows from the 		other table, if there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns 		from the table without the match

6. What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?
	- LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows 		from the right table
	- RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the right table and the matched 		rows from the left table

7. What is an ORM? What do they do?
	- ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping
	- This is used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-		oriented programming languages
	- This allows developers to interact with a database using the pgramming 		languages syntax rather than writing SQL queries
	- Some common ORM frameworks are Python, Java, Ruby, C#, and PHP

8. What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
  	- The differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX and using server-		side library like `requests` in python are:
  		
  		- AJAX runs in client's browser and typically uses JavaScript to make 			requests to a server 
  		- Server-side requests runs on the server, and uses back end server-side 			langauges like Python to make HTTP requests

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token? 
	-  (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack where a malicious 		attacker or someone who is acting, tricks a user into performing actions 		on a web application where they are authenticated
	-  A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value generated by 		the server and included in web forms and requests, and its purpose is to 		prevent attacks ensuring that the request is coming form the actual 		authenticated user

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?
	- In Flask WTForms form.hidden_tag() is used to used to render hidden fields 	that are included in the form. These hidden fields typically include 	security-related data such as CSRF tokens
